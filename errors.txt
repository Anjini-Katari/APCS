How to avoid more heartache- C/P FROM CAT'D FILE

error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:Anjini-Katari/APCS.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
