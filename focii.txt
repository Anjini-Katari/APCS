HW66 -- Where's Your Head At
2022-02-28
time spent: 1.0 hr

I hadn't realized this before, but I was extremely burntout
for the past 2 weeks (at least). It had gotten to the point
where I couldn't get any work or studying done, but felt the 
need to do something. For the first few days of break, I 
worked on healing my mind. I read a lot, went outside, and 
talked to friends online. I also talked to people about how 
to bring back motivation and how to reset after a burnout.
I feel a lot better now, though! Not 100% there, but I'm
getting better, and finding ways to make sure it doesn't
get this bad again.

Notes Pre "The Unplugging":
 * I too, feel my attention span reducing (but then I end
   up reading for hours on end and realize that there is 
   still hope!)
 * I've been wanting to spend at least a few days offline so 
   that I can become more in tune with myself, but I'm always
   worried that someone will need something from me and I 
   just won't see their message. I think this is fixable, 
   though, if I just tell people that I'll be dropping off 
   the face of the earth for an X amount of days. Maybe I'll
   attempt it this summer...
 * "the goal is not to stop using the internet, or even 
   minimize its use, but to put it back into a box in the 
   basement where it belongs"
    * I like this approach becuase I don't think it's possible 
      to fully shut out tech (nor do I think we should), but I 
      agree that we use it excessively
 * "without entering a kind of unsustainable hermit-mode that 
   I can’t wait to rebound from" 
    * I just like this line
 * I've been wanting a typewritter, but now I really want on
    * While this isn't relevant, I did feel like mentioning it
 * "My hope is that any such breakdowns will illuminate the 
   many pointless ways I’ve committed myself to being online 
   all the time"
    * We like to say that you don't realize how much something 
      means to you till you lose it, but I like that this is 
      opposite of that

Notes Post "The Unplugging":
 * "I didn’t crave the internet at all"
    * Love the usage of 'crave' -> it's a word you would use to
      describe wanting chocolate
    * Could this feeling differ by age? Ex. would teens be more 
      prone to 'craving' the internet if we use it more often
 * "I take out my phone every time I finish doing basically 
    anything"
    * I'm so guilty of this...I sometimes put my phone in another
      room, or as my sister to hide it 
 * "By the second day, both reading and meditation were far less 
   effortful than they’ve been for the past few years"
    * I don't doubt that this will have happened eventually, but I
      do doubt that it only took 1 day of no devices for the 
      attention span to increase
 * "seeking gratification on demand"
    * Recently listened to an episode about Dopamine and motivation 
      via the Huberman Podcast -> does having access to the internet
      decrease our dopamine levels? (I'll do some looking and report
      back if I get good results)
 * "pointless reflexive tic"
    * Something else that I also do...
 * "the world feels more like a vast and colorful thing again"
    * :D
 * "will require explicit boundaries, and I will have to practice 
   observing them"
    * I've been trying to do the same, but it takes more patience 
    (with myself) and self control than we think
