**ANATOMY OF METHOD**

public static <RETURNTYPE> <NAME>(ARGUMENTS){
 <BODY>
}

Java is object oriented which means everything is written inside an object

The name of a method can be anything considered valid 
 - main is special -> returntype is void

Arguments - similar to python, just be more specifc via the data types
