\*
Discoveries:
 * be cautious with c/p -> sometimes weird characters get mixed up with your code, which leads to much heartache
 * adding on to the above - if there's something wrong with the file/perhaps the computer ask a friend to run the code for you in their terminal (done with a friend from a different class & teacher)
 * main is really only used for printing the stuff you want the code to print

Unresolved Mysteries 
 * Why do said weird characters pop up?
 * Why doesn't the computer warn you of the weird character? Is there a way to check for them?
 * Is there a more conscice way of writing this code?
 * how would you randomize the names printed in the hello string?
