K39 -- Dated, But Timeless
2021-11-28

Take Aways:
 * It may not feel like it but traits like curiosity and perserverence 
   always pay off
 * Keep your standards high and keep working hard- that's how you'll
   be able to achieve your dreams
 * I know know why this document is called a headfake, and must applaud 
   you, Mr. Mykolyk 

 * Jokes
    - Hearing Macintosh vs Mac
    - This is paper, these are book
    - Not control-alt-delete!!!
    - "Professor Boy"
    - Randy Rag Doll 

 * have specific dreams!
    - being an astronaut vs being in zero-gravity
 
 * when road blocks are ahead:
    - You can always find creative ways to bypass them
      "There's always another way"
    - "Brick walls are not there to keep us out, the brick 
       walls are there to give us a chance to show how 
       badly we want something because the brick walls 
       are there to stop the people who don't want it 
       badly enough. They're there to stop the other people."

 * In anything you do, you have to learn the basics first 
   because without the basics, you can't do any of the 
   cool stuff

 * People being tough on you hurts but they do it because
   they know you can do better

 * put in your all 
    - mindset and enthusiasm 

 * headfake learning
    - doing something with the indirect intention to do 
      something else
    - dance to create discipline 

 * It's ok to change your dreams to make them more achieveable 
    - as long as its something you want, go get it because 
      you probably can

 * Your dreams don't have to be super hard and extrodinary 

 * When you're angry and frustrated at something/someone, give
   it/them time and they'll be able to surprise you
    - "good things come to those who wait"
    - but this doesn't mean 'don't take action' 

 * PHRASING  
    - How you ask questions and say statements can change how 
      people respond to you! 

 * Sometimes your dreams aren't exactly what you though

 * Don't give yourself a limit, don't let anyone give you a limit, 
   don't give anyone a limit 

 * If you do something with pioneering, you will get arrows in your 
   back and you have to put up with it
    - It'll be worth it in the end 

 * Book learning is valuable but not as valuable as hands on projects

 * Have fun
    - Are you a Tigger or Eeyore 

 * Stay Curious 

 * Help Others 

 * Paraphrased: when men are romantically interested in you, ignore 
   what the ysay and look at what they do

 * Be earnest, tell the truth, apologise when you screw up, stay 
   curious, help others, show gratitude 

 * Listen to your feedback, don't make excuses
