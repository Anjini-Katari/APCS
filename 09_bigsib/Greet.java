public class Greet {
	public static void main(String[] args){
                BigSib.Greet("Film");
		BigSib.Greet("Flam");
		BigSib.Greet("Kazaam");
	}
}

\*
Unresolved Mysteries:
 * Still slightly confused as to why this works
 * Does this work if the file/class is in a different dir?

Discoveries:
 * Clarification on how this works! BigSib.Greet says to look at the class BigSib, and run the method Greet
 * Methods and Objects are in Python as well! (Ex. Numpy and Tensorflow for ML)
