public class Greet {
    public static void main( String[] args ){
        System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Crosby") );
        System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Stills") );
        System.out.println( BigSib.greet("Nash") );
    }
}

\*
Unresolved Mysteries: 
 * Is this way considered 'more effecient' than how we did this for the last 
     homework? In other words, should is it better to hace the Systems.out.print in 
     the file executing the method, or the file of the method being defined?

Discoveries:
 * In the Big Sib file from the last hw, there was a print statement -> if you keep 
     that in, the output becomes the name and the greeting statement!
